# Reanalysis of Levofloxacin HPLC Data Using R

This repository contains the reanalysis of data from the published article:

**"A Rapid and Simple High-Performance Liquid Chromatographic Method for Determination of Levofloxacin in Human Plasma"**  
ðŸ”— [https://doi.org/10.22146/ijc.23552](https://doi.org/10.22146/ijc.23552)

## Description

In this project, I reanalyzed the chromatographic data from our previously published research using the **R programming language**. The analysis includes:

- Raw data processing
- Calibration curve generation
- Method validation (accuracy, precision, linearity)
- Data visualization and model evaluation

The goals of this reanalysis are to:

- Promote transparency and reproducibility in research
- Demonstrate the use of R in pharmaceutical and bioanalytical studies
- Provide learning materials for researchers and students
- Explore opportunities for **research collaboration**
